### Features

- Basic & Digest authentication brute force
- Multi-threaded port scanning
- Credentials-first & Route-first devices are supported


This is a **Proof of Concept** that took me exactly 4 days to complete. The source code is sloppy -yet working but not as it should- and requires a lot of work to become a complete project.

###**Help is needed to complete the following:**

- Source code complete refactoring (Threading, Variables, Logic etc)
- Add support for Masscan for quicker port scans
- Extensive tests **especially for Route-first devices** (devices that require the stream path to be known) from people who actually own such devices
- Implement an export function (M3U8 files for VLC, or even iSpy if possible)
- Add support for other protocols (anything that iSpy supports)
